Throughput U.S. history, we have seen a variety of policy enforcement to support either of the two prevalent goals. The U.S. either keeps prisoners sentenced in order to keep crime off the streets or mitigate their sentences in hopes of rehabilitating prisoners. These goals are correlated with the presidential party affiliation. According to popular claims, a Republican presidential term leads to conservative legislation where it is believed that increased crime rates are due to low imprisonment rates – therefore conservative ruled years have typically stiffen policies and increased federal and state prison capacities to incarcerate more offenders. By contrast, Democratic presidential terms have led to progressive moments to reduce sentences and police funding in attempts to give prisoners a second chance. Controversy over these progressive claims have coined the term “revolving door” which explains rise in crime and imprisonment rates due to liniment policies. Our analysis is an attempt to explore these claims by either supporting or rebuking the correlation between presidential policy affiliation along with crime and imprisonment rates. We will be focusing on key political events to answer the following questions throughout our exploratory data analysis. Is there a correlation between crime rates and imprisonment rates throughout states in the U.S.? Are low crime rates correlated with high imprisonment rates during conservative years? Are high crime rates correlate with low imprisonment rates during progressive years? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic: Impact of Criminal Policy Changes on Crime Rate in the United States 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic: Impact of Criminal Policy Changes on Crime Rate in the United States According to the Wall Street Journal opinion Rising Crime Rates Are a Policy Choice, strict U.S. incarceration laws lead to a decrease in crime rates. The article suggests that the implementation of stricter criminal justice policies via a conservative agenda has consistently kept violent crime in check in the past. It claims that in 1991 five out of eight released felons were arrested again for new crimes within three years which coined the term ‘revolving door policy’ meaning weak incarceration laws lead to an increase in crime by repeat offenders. The George H.W. Bush administration was the first to double the federal prison capacity – a practice that was continued by presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush from 1991 to 2013. The article claims that as a result of these practices, violent crime plummeted throughout these 23 years as the number of prisoners went from 800,000 to 1.6 million. Furthermore, the article claims that crime rates resurged as progressive policies were reinstated during the Obama administration. These historical trends have ultimately cultivated a popular narrative where U.S. crime rates are said to be directly influenced by the severity of incarceration laws. This project is to perform a statistical analysis of these claims. We want data to tell a story and see if that story matches with this opinion. 2.2 Data availability For this project, we need broadly three types of data over time: Crime Imprisonment Justice policy changes The sources for these data points are described below: 2.2.1 Crime Crime data is sourced using the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. More than 18,000 law enforcement agencies at different administrative levels (from federal to city) voluntarily submit data to the state UCR or directly to FBI’s UCR. The UCR program is used by criminal justice researchers and students. Yearwise UCR data is visited using the index of UCR publications From 1995 to 1998, data is in a pdf format. From 1999 to 2019, crime data is directly available in Table 5 (except for 2016, where the data is available in Table 3) in xls format categorized by state, nature of offense and kind of area. Year-wise data is described below: Year Link Format How to import? 1995 Link Table 5 pdf Using tabulizer package 1996 Link Table 5 pdf Using tabulizer package 1997 Link Table 5 pdf Using tabulizer package 1998 Link Table 5 pdf Using tabulizer package 1999 Link xls Using readxl package 2000 Link xls Using readxl package 2001 Link xls Using readxl package 2002 Link xls Using readxl package 2003 Link xls Using readxl package 2004 Link xls Using readxl package 2005 Link xls Using readxl package 2006 Link xls Using readxl package 2007 Link xls Using readxl package 2008 Link xls Using readxl package 2009 Link xls Using readxl package 2010 Link xls Using readxl package 2011 Link xls Using readxl package 2012 Link xls Using readxl package 2013 Link xls Using readxl package 2014 Link xls Using readxl package 2015 Link xls Using readxl package 2016 Link xls Using readxl package 2017 Link xls Using readxl package 2018 Link xls Using readxl package 2019 Link xls Using readxl package All of these tables have number of cases reported by state, area (metropolitan statistical area, cities outside metropolitan areas, nonmetropolitan counties) and nature of offense (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson). For every kind of area, the estimated population is present and if the percentage of area reporting is less than 100%, it has an estimated total computed using this method. We will always use estimated total where available. The data has states and areas in columns and the nature of offense in rows. We will read this data and iteratively go through every state and area, choose the estimated total (if available, else area actually reporting), keep those numbers and pivot longer so that the final table has year, state, area, nature of offense, population and number of cases as the columns. We take historical crime data for the whole of United States from 1976 to 1980 from Table 1 of the 1995 report (pdf format), from 1981 to 1999 from Table 1 of the 2000 report (xls format) and from 2000 to 2019 from Table 1 of the 2019 report (xls format). These tables have total number of cases in the United States reported by year and nature of offense (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson) along with the total population of the United States for each year. We will also pivot longer this table so that the final table has year, nature of offense, population and number of cases as the columns. With such a dissection of crime data by state, area and nature of offense, we intend to investigate if the change in crime index across the United States is driven by only one state, area or nature of offense. 2.2.2 Imprisonment Imprisonment data is sourced from using the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has compiled data from NPS as quick tables. We use total number of prison admissions from 1978 to 2019 and total number of prison releases from 1978 to 2019. Both of these tables are in xlsx format so we will use readxl package to import it into R. These tables have the total number of prison admissions and releases by year and by state. The states are along a column and the years are along a row so we will pivot longer so that the final table has state, year and number of prisoners admitted/released as columns. 2.2.3 Justice policy changes Major justice policy changes are listed in this article. This article has led to discovering the following major policy changes which will be a part of this project: Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1984 Atkins v. Virginia Riley v. California New Clemency Initiative If we notice major changes in trend, we will search for more policy changes in that time period and add them.

The UCR program is used by criminal justice researchers and students. Yearwise UCR data is visited using the index of UCR publications. In the proposal, we had planned to extract data of 1995 to 1998 as well, but these are in pdf format and was turning out to be rather difficult to extract. Besides, we can take data from 1999 as well to roughly compare the Bush administration vs the Obama administration in terms of crime. From 1999 to 2019, crime data is directly available in Table 5 (except for 2016, where the data is available in Table 3) in xls format categorized by state, nature of offense and kind of area. In the proposal, we had planned on downloading total crime rates separately, but then figured that we could sum up statewise and make do with that. 3.1.2 Imprisonment Imprisonment data is sourced from the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has compiled data from NPS as quick tables. We use total number of prison admissions from 1978 to 2019, and total number of prison releases from 1978 to 2019. In the proposal we only decided upon the previously mentioned dataset, however we are also exploring imprisonment rate of sentenced prisoners from 1978 to 2019. This will allow us to see the rate which is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 Crime Raw crime data across all years is made in Excel and doesn’t have a clear table structure. For example, Snapshot of data Data from 1999-2002 have a similar format so they are extracted using data_collection/1999-2002.R. Data from 2003 and 2004 are peculiar so they ar extracted using data_collection/2003.R and data_collection/2004.R. Data from 2013-2016 have a similar format so they are extracted using data_collection/2013-2016.R. The rest of the data is extracted using data_collection/2005-2012, 2017-2019.R. The xls links to these years is saved in metadata/crime_data_links.csv so that we don’t have to hardcode URLs.

In the District of Columbia, the report saves the district-wide crime numbers as “Total” instead of “State Total” since DC is not technically a state. We change the label of that as well to “State Total” just for one-to-one correspondence.

Then we proceed to eliminate extra columns such as “Jurisdiction” since it is not necessary to conduct our analysis. We also properly rename our desired columns into State, Year, Admissions, Releases, and Rate.

These tables have the total number of prison admissions, releases, and imprisonment rates by year and by state. The states are along a column and the years are along a row so we will pivot_longer() function so that the final table has state, year and number of prisoners admitted/released/rates as columns. Now that we have converted all three data frames into the desired long format, we can proceed to apply an inner join on the admissions_data_long and releases_data_long by State and Year. Then we apply another inner join on the resulting data frame with the rate_data_long. Now we have one clean table that encapsulates five columns: State, Year, Admissions, Releases, and Rate and 1,512 rows of entries.

There are some missing values in crime categories other than arson, which we checked is actually blank in the raw data. We will fill these with 0. Arson has been blank or missing in all raw data across all years so we will drop that column. 3.3.2 Imprisonment There are missing values through Admissions, Releases, and Rate values across States. However, the numbers are quite insignificant in comparison to the available data that is present in the total_imprisonment_data data frame. According to the bar chart, Only 1.2% of Releases and Rate data are missing. Admissions takes the lead with 1.39% of missing values. We also plotted the missing values of rows in order to see if there is a pattern across different features. It seems that the missing values originate from a single row – indicating that they are related to a specific state. Now we will highlight missing values of specific States. There some missing values for Alabama and New Hampshire for Admissions data. There are also missing values across all variables for District of Columbia from 2001-2019 since sentenced felons were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons during these years. We will keep these entries since we are simply visualizing information provided from the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of crime and imprisonment 4.2 Analysis of imprisonment with crime", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of crime and imprisonment 4.1.1 Crime Crime rate is the number of crimes per 100,000 population. Below is the trend of crime rate from 1999 to 2019. Clearly, property crime has a higher incidence rate than violent crimes which is to be expected. We can also observe a general downward trend for both kinds of crime, however less pronounced for violent crimes. We now look at a statewise heatmap to identify which states have the highest crime incidence. In terms of state totals, the worst crime rate in recent years is in District of Columbia, Alaska, Arkansas and New Mexico. The best crime rates in recent years are in West Virginia, Vermont, New Hampshire and Connecticut states. We will compare the imprisonment rates of these states with the crime rates over time later. 4.1.2 Imprisonment Analysis Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners per 100,000 population. Below is the trend of imprisonment rate. Clearly the imprisonment rate has started dipping since 2008 (the year the administration changed from Republican to Democrat). Below is the trend of imprisonment admissions and releases. Admissions and Releases generally track each other every year. However, admissions were more than releases till 2008 and it flipped order in 2008 (the year the administration changed from Republican to Democrat). Rate represents the imprisonment rate of sentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal authorities per 100,000 U.S. residents whereas admissions and releases is measured by the count of number of prisoners. Therefore, we convert to log base 10 in order to view the differently scaled variables on a common scale. The following heatmap demonstrates the missing values in grey that were highlighted in section 3.3 where the District of Columbia stopped registering values after 2001 across Admissions, Releases, and Rate. We also see a drastic increase in California Admissions and Releases where values were low from 1978-1985 (soft yellow) and then spiked in Admissions from 1985-2012 (bright red) which seems to be balanced off by the Releases from 1985-2012. Illinois has high Admissions numbers from the years 2002-2012 which seem to balance with the high releases from 2000-2012. Florida also has high admissions from 1987-1992 and 2000-2008 and high releases in the years 1987-1994 and 1998-2007. Overall it seems the Admissions and Releases heatmaps seems to have a direct correlations where one increases and so does the other. This is not the case with Rate – it seems the imprisonment rate has gradually increased throughout the years across all states except Minnesota, Massachusetts and Maine where the rate has somewhat stabilized. In terms of state totals, the worst imprisonment in recent years is in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois. The best imprisonment in recent years are in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine and Minnesota. We will compare the imprisonment rates of these states with the crime rates over time later. 4.2 Analysis of imprisonment with crime As mentioned in the proposal, we will analyze and emphasize on the years that the following policies were placed into effect in the U.S. We will also consider the presidential party during these highlighted years. Major justice policy changes are listed in this article. This article has led to discovering the following major policy changes which will be a part of this project: Policy Year Party Comprehensive Crime Control Act 1984 Republican Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 1984 Republican Atkins v. Virginia 2002 Republican Riley v. California 2014 Democratic New Clemency Initiative 2014 Democratic Since we don’t have crime data before 1999, we cannot determine if the policy changes in 1984 had an effect. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Link to VizHub visualization. Click on the year on the top to toggle crime rates between 2002 and 2014. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In the year 2002, we observe an increase in imprisonment rates across the shortlisted states. This year correlates with the passing of Atkins v. Virginia under which the U.S. was under a republican party. In the year 2014, we observe a decrease in imprisonment rates across the shortlisted states. This year saw a democratic election with the enforcement of policies that stemmed from Riley v. California and the New Clemency Initiative. So, in terms of imprisonment rates, the data agrees with the opinion’s claim. However, crime rates aren’t necessarily negatively tracking imprisonment rates, i.e., crime rates aren’t necessarily increasing with a decrease in imprisonment rates. For example, in Texas, Vermont, Florida and California, crime rates are decreasing with a decrease in imprisonment rates. The only state that shows significant negative correlation is West Virginia. Overall, the analysis of imprisonment data and crime data don’t given enough evidence to support the article’s claim.
